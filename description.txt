Major Update summaries:

v1.2.2, The Shadow Update 2: Reworks the Shadow Amalgamation to be closer to a boss.

v1.2.1, The Boulder (and sword) Update: Adds boss log support, a boulder miniboss, enough beam swords for a sword only playthrough to be possible, and buffs 5 vanilla beam swords. It also balances some stuff. 

v1.2, The Rework Update: Completely rebalances the mod, resprites most items (and the Shadow Amalgamation), and adds some things.
