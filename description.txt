Immortal Shadows is just another content mod.
It doesn't add much right now, but will hopefully have lots of content in the future!

Current content:
32 items
2 NPCs
1 tile
3 buffs
1 miniboss

Changelogs are in the discord server, a link is provided at the homepage (GitHub)

Credits:
Example Mod/tmod devs, for teaching me how to code.
Whoever made the AM2R OST, since one of its tracks is used in the mod.
