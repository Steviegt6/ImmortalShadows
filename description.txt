(Credits and update summaries below)
Immortal Shadows is just another content mod.
It doesn't add much right now, but will hopefully have lots of content in the future!
Full changelogs are in the discord server, a link is provided at the homepage (GitHub)

Current content:
48 items
2 minibosses
1 enemy
1 town NPC
Boss Checklist and Census support

Major Update summaries:

v1.2.1, The Boulder (and sword) Update: Adds boss log support, a sentient boulder miniboss, enough beam swords for a sword only playthrough to be possible, and buffs 5 vanilla beam swords. It also balances some stuff. 

v1.2, The Rework Update: Completely rebalances the mod, resprites most items (and the miniboss), and adds some things.

v1.1, The Shadow Update: Adds a new shadow miniboss, and balances a lot of recipes.
